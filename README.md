# Basic-Level-of-Chatbot

It is a basic level of chatbot for Bus ticket booking. The dataset here used is downloaded from an Open source platform of SETC buses. The Fare column in Dataset was created by entering random numbers just to calculate for Educational purpose. 

We are strongly advised to not check the fare price. It is random based. 

Also I deployed the Bus ticket booking bot. Here the link - https://tejeshwar0104.pythonanywhere.com/
